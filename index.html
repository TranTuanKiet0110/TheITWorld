                  <p>
                    Hello everyone, my team is Power Soft, and I write this report to introduce about our team, our project ideas and things that we decided to do in the future. 
                    First of all, I will introduce about my personality and what kind of teammate that I want in my team. 
                    As I am an introverted person, so I would prefer to work with calm teammate. 
                    It means that my teammate should concentrate on their work and they must respect other people in our team.

                  <p>
                    Besides, I can work with any kind of people, but I like a calmly working environment, so I prefer to work with friendly and calmly teammate. 
                    In addition, I don’t like laziness so I would like to work with someone who really try hard in their project. 
                    Aside from working, it is very boring if you just keep working for hours and hours, I prefer someone who can make other people laugh or a funny person to join our team. 
                    Lastly, we always welcome who is willing to help others.

                  <p>
                    Overall, my project will be about a website or an app on smartphone. 
                    I think I will build a music website that allow users to upload music or their covers. 
                    This website is quite the same as many existing websites on google. For example, zing mp3 or nhac cua tui. 
                    Therefore, I’m aiming to make a website like that but there will be something different from the existing websites. 
                   </p>
                   <p>About the motivation for this project, I think it is because I am a person who really like to listen to music, and I know that a lot of people love music too. 
                     Therefore, I decided to make a website for everyone, so that they can search and listen to a song that they want. 
                     Secondly, music can help people relax after a long working hour. 
                     Moreover, music helps us to slow down our heart rate, lower our blood pressure. 
                     Scientists studied arterial function and blood flow on 10 healthy volunteers, the result is joyful music produced a 26% increase in blood flow and its benefit is the same as an aerobic exercise. 
                     Therefore, we can conclude that music is helpful for our health.
                    </p>

              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="right-image-post">
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-md-6">
                <div class="left-text">
                  <h4></h4>
                  <p>
                    So now I will go detail into the website that I decided to do. 
                    My website will be quite the same as Facebook and other music website or I think it will be a combination of both. 
                    The purpose of making this website is for the user or musician to easily connect and share beautiful songs with their friends, their family or maybe they can share it to users all over the world. 
                    Moreover, the user can livestream and cover or sing a song that they want. 
                    The user doesn’t need to worry about the number of audiences watching and listen to their song. 
                    If there aren’t enough audience for the livestream, this website will automatically recommend you to other users, so that you can gain more views. 
                    Finally, I create this website to make the user who want to become a famous singer or a popular musician with a lot of fans. 
                    If those who are scared to stand on stage or maybe they want to become a singer, but they can’t or whatever reasons, this website can help you make your dream become reality. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So now is about the services that my website provides for the users. 
                    In this website, it will be divided into 3 sections; a musical library where the user can find the song that they want to listen and a user profile page which content all the information and the cover that the user uploaded. 
                    The last section is livestream, this section allowed users to directly interact with other users like what Facebook and YouTube have and the livestream content must be about music. 
                    Moreover, all kind of emoji, comment and donation will be included to make the livestream more interest and to create a user-friendly environment.  
                    In the musical library section, the user can find many popular songs with different genres and different languages too. 
                    This section is quite the same as many websites about music have, for example, zing mp3… 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    About the user profile, it will look like the profile on Facebook where you can upload picture, videos about you to share with the others. 
                    In addition, I will include follow function into my website, so that if someone that you idolize, you can easily get notification or update about their new product. 
                    Last but not least, the function chat or video call are necessary for users to communicate with each other easily and faster. 
                    In conclusion, that is all the things that I planned for my future project.

                    There are a numerous of songs all over the world with different genres and artists, so about the tools and technologies, I will need Oracle Apex to create a database management. 
                    Also, not just for managing songs, I will need this database management for the user profiles and all the videos that they uploaded. Not only that, design a database management is not enough for a website. 
                    I think I will need Visual Studio Code to design a website interface that look eye-catching to the users. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Design a website like the above will required a lot of different skills. 
                    For example, to design a database management system, you need to be familiar with MySQL or Oracle Apex language in other to make it work perfectly. 
                    The indispensable thing is you need to have a web designer skill and a skill to decorate a website. 
                    Design a website is very important as well as database management, you need to design it clearly, make it beautiful, so that your website can attract more user attentions. 
                    Therefore, I think I need to improve my skills in HTML, CSS and anything that related to the website.

                    If my project is successful, there will be a musical website on google and everyone can find their favourite songs. 
                    They can chat with their friend while relaxing with music or they can watch musical livestream to change their mood. 
                    As a developer of this website, I think it will strongly impact on the musician, the producer and the singer. 
                    Because this website can automatically gain audiences for the users if they low views. 
                    Therefore, the problem of paying money to advertise yourself will be solve and you can gain more views through this website as it automatically introduces you to the other users.

                    As I develop this website, I have received a lot of feedbacks from my friends and my classmates. 
                    Some of them said that this is a beautiful project, some said this project could help a lot of people when they stress or after doing their works. 
                    Of course, when doing a project, you will receive a lot of feedback, some will be about how well you did on the project, some will about the improvement of the project. 
                    It is necessary to receive feedback to know where my weak points are, so that I can improve my project to make it perfect. 
                    Not just only compliments, I also receive some feedbacks about the improvement of the project. 
                    For example, you need to include some special event for the users to inspire them to keep using your website.

                    <b><u>• Cloud computing:</u></b>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Cloud computing is the essential technology that a website or an application nowadays need to have. 
                    The reason why cloud computing is very important for any application is that cloud computing works like a data storage (cloud storage). 
                    Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services, it includes servers, storage, databases, networking… 
                    So why many large companies decided to choose this technology for their applications?  
                    Cloud computing have a numerous of advantages. 
                    Firstly, using cloud computing can save money because it does not need any physical hardware investments. 
                    Using cloud computing, you can direct store data on their servers. 
                    Secondly, cloud computing has almost limitless storage capacity. 
                    You can expand your cloud storage at any time with a very reasonable monthly fee. 
                    Thirdly, the important of cloud computing is back-up and restore data. 
                    When you store data on cloud, it is very easy to back-up and recover your data. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Moreover, back-up data by using cloud is faster and cheaper. 
                    Last but not least, cloud computing has high speed of data transition, all you just need to do is a few clicks and then you can get the resources required for your system within fewer minutes. 
                    Although cloud computing has a lot of advantages, there are some disadvantages within this technology. 
                    First of all, the problem that we mostly face is internet connection. 
                    You can not access to the cloud if you don’t the internet or if your internet connection is weak. 
                    Therefore, you can not upload and store your data on to the cloud. 
                    In addition, another drawback of using cloud computing services is the security risk. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Before using cloud computing service, you need to know that you will be sharing all your company’s sensitive information to the third-party cloud computing service provider. 
                    Therefore, hacker might access to this information if the provider has a weak security. 
                    Thirdly, if the cloud service provider is being cyber-attack, so it will significantly affect the performance of your shared resource. 
                    Normally, when using cloud service, you may encounter these cases, for example, server downtime, server maintenance or maybe your may face power loss…  
                    Lastly, you may face this problem if your company have a lot of data to store. 
                    Cloud computing company just provide a limit bandwidth to their users. 
                    So, in case you want to pass the limitation, you will need to charge more money which might be costly.

                    Cloud computing is causing a major shift for the whole IT industry. 
                    This technology allowed us to access to the application through a web browser, which means there is no IT cost for the hardware or servers. 
                    Moreover, this change can cause harmful effect to many industries on the world. 
                    For example, there are a lot of hardware has been produced but the customer doesn’t need these products anymore. 
                    So, it will cause a big loss in money of the industries which they used to invest in their products. 
                    In addition, if the loss money is increasing, the industry will be closed.
                  </p>
                  <p>Cloud computing is not only affecting the IT industry, it also affects the way that the employees work nowadays. 
                    When you introduce a new technology to the company, so all the employees need to have a training based on this technology. 
                    Because this is a new technology, therefore some people will feed uncomfortable or unfamiliar when working with this technology. 
                    Moreover, the need for the IT support staff will be reduced, but the company have to pay for the training costs of the employees. 
                    Also, cloud computing can affect our daily life in many different ways. 
                    For example, cloud computing can save your money; using cloud computing is cheaper than buying a 
                    physical hardware to store more data.

                  <p>
                    Cybersecurity means defending computers, servers, networks, mobile devices electronic systems from a malicious attack. 
                    Cybersecurity is very common nowadays; it is also represented as a software on your computer or devices. 
                    For example, anti-virus, anti-spam, … 
                  </p>
                  <p>Cybersecurity and privacy have a lot of benefits and because of these advantages, many companies decided to include this technology into their system. 
                    First of all, this technology provides a protection for your business. 
                    Cybersecurity will help your employees to get rid of malware and ransomware. 
                    Moreover, your business’s data will be protected by this technology, so the chance of hacker break into your business will be reduce. 
                    Also, your computer can avoid many harmful viruses to steal or delete your data. 
                    By eliminating viruses, it will increase your company’s productivity and the cost for server’s maintenance will be reduce too. 
                    Secondly, the most common problem that many companies try to solve is protect their customer’s accounts. 
                    For example, the information of a bank account must be kept secret. 
                    If your business could avoid this problem, therefore it will inspire customer confidence in using your services and your business’s profit will be increase.  
                    Moreover, by gaining trusts from many customers, these customers will introduce your service to other people, so your service become more popular and widely spread to the other countries. 
                  </p>
                  <p>In contrast, there are some drawbacks that usually occur when using cybersecurity technology. 
                    In other to use this cybersecurity software and to get the full functions of the software, you need to pay a large amount of money. When using computer build-in software such as windows defender, firewall, it usually gets out of date. 
                    Therefore, the software keeps updating in order to keep the protection up to date which normally cause uncomfortable experiences to the users. 
                    As the software keep updating, it requires more disk space. 
                    This is the reason that make our computers working slowly than before. 
                    Moreover, firewall is difficult to configure correctly, so it may prohibit users from performing tasks on the internet. 
                    This also make the users feel uncomfortable because of the access denied.

                    Cybersecurity and privacy are also causing the change in the IT industry. 
                    This technology helps many companies to protect their information and their customers information too. 
                    If this technology involves in many companies, so less employees will be need for the business security section. 
                    But you need to pay money to purchase this technology and to train the employees, so that they can master this new technology. 
                    In order to work with this new technology, the level of requirement of the employee will be higher than before, therefore, many employees cannot meet the requirement of the job and they will lose their job. 
                    In addition, this technology also helps us in our daily life too. 
                    It protects the users from getting to the harmful websites and it keeps users personal information secret. 
                    As I think cybersecurity is the best way to keep our personal information safety.
